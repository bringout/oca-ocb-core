# Automated Action Rules


This module allows to implement action rules for any object.
============================================================

Use automated actions to automatically trigger actions for various screens.

**Example:** A lead created by a specific user may be automatically set to a specific
Sales Team, or an opportunity which still has status pending after 14 days might
trigger an automatic reminder email.
