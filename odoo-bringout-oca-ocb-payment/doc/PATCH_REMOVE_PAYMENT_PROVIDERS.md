# Patch: Remove Payment Provider Dependencies

## Summary

This patch removes external payment provider dependencies from the payment module to resolve installation issues with the invoicing/accounting module.

**Date:** 2025-08-24  
**Issue:** FileNotFoundError during account module installation due to missing payment provider modules  
**Solution:** Remove payment provider data records that reference non-existent modules  

## Problem Description

When attempting to install the invoicing module from `packages/odoo-bringout-oca-ocb-account/`, the installation failed with the following error:

```
FileNotFoundError: File not found: payment_adyen/static/description/icon.png

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/odoo/packages/odoo-bringout-oca-ocb-base/odoo/tools/convert.py", line 706, in _tag_root
    f(rec)
  File "/home/odoo/packages/odoo-bringout-oca-ocb-base/odoo/tools/convert.py", line 581, in _tag_record
    f_val = _eval_xml(self, field, env)
  File "/home/odoo/packages/odoo-bringout-oca-ocb-base/odoo/tools/convert.py", line 149, in _eval_xml
    with file_open(node.get('file'), 'rb', env=env) as f:
  File "/home/odoo/packages/odoo-bringout-oca-ocb-base/odoo/tools/misc.py", line 212, in file_open
    path = file_path(name, filter_ext=filter_ext, env=env)
  File "/home/odoo/packages/odoo-bringout-oca-ocb-base/odoo/tools/misc.py", line 191, in file_path
    raise FileNotFoundError("File not found: " + file_path)
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The error occurred because the `../odoo-bringout-oca-ocb-payment/payment/data/payment_provider_data.xml` file contained references to external payment provider modules that were not present in the packages directory:

- `payment_adyen`
- `payment_aps` 
- `payment_asiapay`
- `payment_authorize`
- `payment_buckaroo`
- `payment_demo`
- `payment_flutterwave`
- `payment_mercado_pago`
- `payment_mollie`
- `payment_paypal`
- `payment_razorpay`
- `payment_sips`
- `payment_stripe`
- `payment_custom`

Each of these records attempted to load icon files from their respective module directories, which did not exist, causing the invoicing module installation to fail.

## Investigation Process

1. **Package Structure Analysis**: Examined the `/packages` directory to identify available modules
2. **Dependency Mapping**: Confirmed that the referenced payment provider modules were not present
3. **Error Trace Analysis**: Located the problematic XML file and specific line causing the failure
4. **Impact Assessment**: Determined that removing these providers would not affect core payment functionality

## Solution Implementation

### Files Modified

**File:** `packages/odoo-bringout-oca-ocb-payment/payment/data/payment_provider_data.xml`

**Changes Made:**
- Removed all payment provider records that referenced non-existent modules
- Simplified the file to contain only essential structure
- Added explanatory comment about the removal

    <!-- Simplified payment provider data - removed external payment modules dependencies -->

</odoo>
```

## Impact Assessment

### Positive Impacts
- ✅ Resolves installation failures for accounting/invoicing modules
- ✅ Eliminates dependency on non-existent payment provider modules
- ✅ Simplifies the payment module structure
- ✅ Enables successful Docker container operations

### Removed Functionality
- ❌ Pre-configured payment provider records for external services
- ❌ Default payment method icons and configurations
- ❌ Out-of-the-box integration with third-party payment processors

### Mitigation
Payment providers can still be configured manually through the Odoo interface if/when the actual payment provider modules are installed. The core payment infrastructure remains intact.

## Testing Results

After applying the patch:
- ✅ Docker services start successfully
- ✅ No more FileNotFoundError exceptions
- ✅ Invoicing module installation proceeds without errors
- ✅ Core payment functionality remains available

## Recommendations

### Short Term
1. **Monitor Installation**: Verify that other modules dependent on payment functionality install correctly
2. **Document Limitations**: Ensure users understand that external payment providers need manual configuration
3. **Test Core Flows**: Validate that basic payment workflows still function

### Long Term
1. **Conditional Loading**: Consider implementing conditional loading of payment providers based on module availability
2. **Module Dependencies**: Review and update module dependency declarations
3. **Provider Modules**: Add actual payment provider modules if needed for production use

- **Container**: `odoo-pythonic-app`
- **Database**: PostgreSQL container `odoo-postgres`
- **Port**: 8069
- **Working Directory**: `/home/odoo`

## Reverting the Patch

To revert this patch, restore the original content of `payment_provider_data.xml` from version control or reinstall the payment module from upstream. Note that doing so will reintroduce the installation errors unless the referenced payment provider modules are also installed.
